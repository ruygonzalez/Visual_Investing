# Visual_Investing

In this project, we explored the daily closing price of stock from the past year (from 04/04/2019 - 04/04/2020) visually through various line graphs and histograms. Primarily, the goal was to create intuitive and visual ways to understand the market and we tried to explain various important investing concepts in the uploaded paper. We were also interested in seeing the effects of COVID-19 on the stocks amongst several different industries and within a single industry to help us gain insight into the current and future market.

This repository contains the paper and the code that generate the graphs. All of the data was sourced from Yahoo Finance.
